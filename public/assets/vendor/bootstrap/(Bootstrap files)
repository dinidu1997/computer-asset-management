The /computer-asset-management/computer-asset-management/public/assets/vendor/bootstrap directory is intended to contain the Bootstrap framework files. Since these files are typically large and consist of multiple components (CSS, JS, fonts, etc.), I will provide a brief overview of what files you would typically include in this directory, rather than generating the actual content of each file.

You would typically include the following files in the Bootstrap directory:

1. **bootstrap.min.css** - The minified CSS file for Bootstrap.
2. **bootstrap.css** - The unminified CSS file for Bootstrap.
3. **bootstrap.bundle.min.js** - The minified JavaScript file that includes Bootstrap's JavaScript components and Popper.js.
4. **bootstrap.bundle.js** - The unminified JavaScript file that includes Bootstrap's JavaScript components and Popper.js.
5. **bootstrap.min.css.map** - The source map for the minified CSS file.
6. **bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map** - The source map for the minified JavaScript file.

To set up the Bootstrap files, you can download the latest version of Bootstrap from the official Bootstrap website and extract the contents into the /public/assets/vendor/bootstrap directory.

If you need specific files or a specific version of Bootstrap, please let me know!
